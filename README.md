# github-crawler-python

GitHub crawler using Python(BeautifulSoap, UrlLib, Requests).

This program connects to Github and generates one file per language selected on code, inside every file has a list with users with most followers and the followers's usernames. The amount of users also are adjustable.

The project load-neo4j-java(https://github.com/thiagobrsilva/load-neo4j-java) is using the result of this program to create a different visualization using Neo4j.

Ps. Using GitHub API is another approach.
